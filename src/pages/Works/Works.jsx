          I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
          And I'll fear no evil because I'm blind to it all
          And my mind and my gun, they comfort me
          Because I know I'll kill my enemies when they come

          [Verse 2]
          Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life
          And I will dwell on this earth forevermore
          Still, I walk beside the still waters, and they restore my soul
          But I can't walk on the path of the right because I'm wrong

          [Verse 3]
          Well, I came upon a man at the top of a hill
          Called himself the savior of the human race
          Said he come to save the world from destruction and pain
          But I said, "How can you save the world from itself?"

          [Outro]
          'Cause I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
          And I'll fear no evil because I'm blind
          Oh, and I walk beside the still waters, and they restore my soul
          But I know when I die, my soul is damned`}/>
